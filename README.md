# Mitochondria-Segementation
Semantic Segmentation of mitochondria.
Semantic Segmentation is a pixel level classification which has many applications. 
In this project a very basic method for segmentation of mitochodria in cell images has been implementad using U-Net.
U-Net is a one of the most popular and widely used architecture for image segmentation. The original paper on U-Net can be found on [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597)
The original training subvolume and description of the dataset is available [here]https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/data/data-em/
